  <p> Hello my name is Polthagorn Onthong.<br>
  I am a student at Thammasat University, studying in the Faculty of Computer Engineering.<br>

  I have a passion for both art and technology, and I love combining them.<br>
  I enjoy building Gunpla models and painting figures.<br>
  By studying engineering, I can take my hobby to the next level—for example, by adding electronics to my models to make them more dynamic and alive.<br>
